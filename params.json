{"name":"Genetics and Evolution","tagline":"","body":"\r\n<center>GenEvol App Manual</center>\r\n====================\r\n\r\n***\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n------------------------------------\r\nThis app was created to help students in Genetics and Evolution courses solve problems and understand course material. The focal courses on which the app is based are offered in [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/geneticsevolution) and at [Duke University](http://duke.edu/), but the material is covered in introductory genetics and evolution courses \r\n\r\nPROBLEM-SOLVER\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n* Genetic cross mapping -- accepts genotype counts for three genes from a \"test cross\", and uses the\r\ncounts to infer the gametic phase, the recombination rate between the three genes, and the gene order.\r\n\r\n* Breeder's equation heritability -- with any three of the following values, calculates the fourth:\r\nstarting phenotype, selected phenotype, response phenotype, broad-sense heritability.\r\n\r\n* Hardy-Weinberg -- accepts genotype counts for a single gene and outputs observed genotype\r\nfrequencies, expected genotype frequencies, and the coefficient of inbreeding (F).\r\n\r\n* Population Growth -- with any of the following 3 values, calculates the fourth: Initial\r\nPopulation, Final Population, Time in years, Growth Rate (or separate birth/death rates)\r\n\r\nPROBLEM-GENERATOR\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\nGenerate a nearly infinite number of practice problems! Supports creation and sharing of a pdf of practice problems.\r\n\r\nThe Single Problem Generator generates a single practice problem of the type specified, with the answer accessible via a single click. \r\nThe Multiple Problem Generator lets you generate a large set of problems as a pdf and share them. All you have to do is specify the number of each type of problem you would like to generate. The pdf will have all the problems in the beginning and answers at the end. \r\n\r\nSELF TEST QUIZ\r\n-------------------------------------\r\nGenetics vocabulary-- multiple-choice quiz yourself on some common basic genetic terms. \r\n\r\nALLELE FREAK SIMULATOR\r\n-------------------------------------\r\nTrack and graph the fate of alleles over multiple generations based on relative fitness, genetic drift etc\r\n\r\nCROSS SIMULATOR\r\n-------------------------------------\r\nSimulate various types of Mendelian crosses. results are displayed in Punnett Square format, and resulting genotypes/phenotypes and ratios are displayed.\r\n\r\nIn the first page select the arguments for the cross (organism type, number of traits, inheritance type, and genotypes of the male and female). Press Next to view the cross and ratio of offspring phenotypes. Press Back to change the arguments.\r\n\r\nABOUT APP\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAndroid Developers: Alex Dao, Jonathan Tseng\r\n\r\niOS Developer: Russell B Myers\r\n\r\nVersion: 1.0 (December 2014)\r\n\r\nFor use with Introduction to Genetics and Evolution at Duke University (Bio 202), taught by\r\nProfessor Mohamed Noor.\r\n***\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
